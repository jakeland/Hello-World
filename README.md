Hello World!

	This is where I shall be storing the contents of my README. 
	
	I am interested in computing because I have always enjoyed logic puzzles,
	as well as the use of computers in my everyday life. I wish to create video games 
	sometime in the near future and believe that computers open up new areas of exploration every day.
	
	
	I shall also be using it to talk about 5 websites,
	their target audience and their call to action.
	
	Site 1. Facebook.com
	Call to action: Sign-Up!
	Target Audience: Everyone. Facebook makes money off of ads and 
	data, so the more people they have on site, the better.
	They accomplish this quite well  and practically effortlessly, due to
	the psychological need of people to connect.
	Use of the Golden Ratio: 
	Absolutely. The golden Ratio has been used to divide the page quite well.
	The first 3rd of the page is divided again, 
	so that the header and logo reside in the first 9th of the page.
	The picture takes up about a third of the length of the page, and 
	the hieght is approx. 1.67 it's width.
	
	Site 2. Tumblr.com
	Call to Action: Look at cool stuff.
	Target audience: anyone (over 13 for legal reasons)
	Tumblr creates a space to easily look at, produce, find, and share 
	unique, interesting, witty and intellegent blogposts with minimal effort. 
	The opening page is beautiful. showing posts deemed awesome from different categories.
	Use of the Golden Ratio: Definitly. One can easily find this used in the first 6 images on the login/signup page
	You will see 5 images surrounding a larger picture on the left and top. 
	This creates a grid, which if you look at closely, you will se the larger picture 
	takes about two thirds of both the rows and columns. Also,
	the images are all scaled to fit the golden ratio.
	
	Site 3. Amazon.com
	Call to action: Buy stuff.
	Target Audience: people who want to buy things without going to the store.
	Amazon.com is getting so good at marketing its putting physical retailers out of business.
	(cough cough best buy cough cough). It does this by having a large armada of shipping trucks,
	Quick delivery and yearly payed services, as well as producing great items such as the kindle.
	Golden Ratio:
	Amazon.com is often getting a facelift, so at it's current design it does follow the golden ratio.
	The center image takes up about 2/3rds of the screen, and the side bars take up about 1/3. I found this interesting,
	because it doesn't follow a grid as well, but I like the variety slightly better for it.
	
	Site 4 Reddit.com
	Call to action: read.
	Target Audience: just about everyone.
	Reddit's variety and ability to be first to jump on a story with credible information make it 
	a leading source of information, news, entertainment, and help.
	If it's been made, it's probably on Reddit.
	Golden Ratio. 
	The color scheme on Reddit is designed to make things pop out at you, so its kind of distracting.
	I do not believe I can find an instance of golden ratio on the site, however I feel that strictly
	attaching this ideal to the site based on an ideal look would be a hinderence and a detriment.
	The site is about making posts and having discussions, so the less constraints put on the size of titles 
	of the post, or pictures in posts is actually a plus for users.
	
	Site 5. google.com
	Call to action: Search.
	Target Audience: people that want to look for something.
	Nobody uses bing. Cause they can search for things easier on google.
	Golden Ratio.
	Surprisingly Yes. The golden ratio is used to create a blank space 
	that borders the google logo and search bar.
